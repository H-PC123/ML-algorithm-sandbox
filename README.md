# CSI4106_Project
Trains AI models on the MINST dataset using a handful of differernt learner implementations as seen in CSI 4106
Performs 10 fold cross validations to evaluate performance

Run python k_fold_x_validation.py from inside project directory to predict model performance

All implementations are written from scratch and based on lecture material

See libraries_used to ensure all dependencies are installed before running
all code tested using python 3.7.0
